This Sift aggregates all your taxi email receipts into an insightful dashboard. It currently supports Uber, Hailo and Addison Lee receipts. If you enable currency conversion it will convert those expenses abroad into your local currency or any currency of your choice.

## Social coding
We like pull requests. If you want to fork it, add your own functionality, run it on your own data  and share it with the world, that's also cool.
